Artificial Intelligence chatbot using Machine Learning.

This is a simple AI chatbot application developed using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library and the Tkinter GUI toolkit. The chatbot is designed to have conversations with users in natural language and respond to their queries about First Aid. I am using this as my final project for the Duke of Edinburgh Bronze Award. The AI has access to all my notes and information I have learned and collected.

# Dependencies

  *Python 3.5 or higher

  *NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

  *Tkinter GUI Toolkit

# Features
The chatbot is designed to have conversations with users in natural language and respond to their queries. It has the following features:

The chatbot can respond to user queries on various topics such as greetings, weather, and news.
It uses NLTK for natural language processing, which allows it to understand and interpret user queries.
It uses Tkinter for the GUI, making it easy to use and navigate.

# Usage
1. Open the chatbot directory in the terminal:

```cd ai-chatbot```

2. Run the chatbot:

```python chatbot.py```

The chatbot will open in a new window. You can start a conversation by typing in the text field at the bottom of the window and pressing enter.
The chatbot will respond to your queries and continue the conversation until you close the window.
