The primary survey involves assessing the ABC (airway, breathing, circulation) and the secondary survey involves providing first aid for found injuries and gathering a history, symptoms, allergies, medications, past and present medical history, last meal and events leading up to the injury, and vital signs.

Fianlly, ongoing casualty care is being responsible for the casualty after first aid and waiting for medical aid.

          "Breathing emergencies caused by illnesses include asthma, allergies, COPD, congestive heart failure, and stroke. Severe allergic reactions can lead to anaphylaxis, which is an allergic reaction to a foreign object that entered the body. Choking occurs when something is blocking the airway passage. First aid for choking depends on the air exchange and if the casualty is conscious or not. For larger people and disabled people in wheelchairs, the procedure is slightly different. If the casualty is an infant, the procedure is slightly different as well. Hypoxia is the lack of oxygen in the bloodstream due to choking or other airway issues. Effective and ineffective breathing can be recognized by the breathing rhythms and intervals between breaths. Inhalation injuries occur when the casualty inhales hot steam, smoke, or poisonous chemicals. (https://docs.google.com/document/d/15a-WWYbZIUt8pbOXvR8CsExY5CMJjbwTI36laIzt49A/edit?usp=sharing)",
